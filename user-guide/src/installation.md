# Installation

Installation steps depend on your operating system and if you are using from source code or binary file.

## From Source Code

To run from source, you'll need to setup your programming enviornment. The source code is written in **Javascript** and **Rust**. So get those installed first. Then there are dependencies after that. 

### Enviornment

npm & nodeJS

[nodeJS (Runtime)](https://www.nodejs.org)
- [React(Framework)](https://www.react.dev)
- [Redux(State Framework)](https://redux.js.org)
- [Material UI(Styling Framework)](https://www.mui.com)
- [React-PDF(Framework)](https://www.react-pdf.org)

Rust

[Rust (Language)](https://www.rust-lang.org)
 - [Tauri (Framework)](https://www.tauri.app)
  - Also install cli with ```cargo install tauri-cli```


### Dependencies

The database runs on SQLite3, so you might need lib files for that.

## From Binary

### Windows

Extract the .zip folder. Right click Hovedbok.exe and select "Send to Desktop (shortcut)".

### Linux

Currently unavailable. While the code works, both AppImage and deb bundles currently are not working. Resort to **From Source Code**.
