# Restocking Products

To restock products, enter Restock Mode. This is done from File -> Restock Mode (hotkey: Ctrl + R). This will add green dots with + signs on each product. Click the dot ontop of the product to increment the stock by 1. This is method is better for many products getting a few increments. If you're adding a large quantity to just one or a few products, you might want to use the Edit Mode instead.
