# Editing Products

To edit products, enter Edit Mode. This is done from File -> Edit Mode (hotkey: Ctrl + E). This will add purple dots on each product. Click the dot ontop of the product you either want to edit or delete.

## Edit Options

You'll see that this loads in all the details into what looks just like the New Product window. Only, now, the SKU is locked. You are free to make changes to any other field. This can be an easy way to restock an item if you need to add a large quantity. Or if a product is returned and you need to discredit a sale and reduce the sold counter.

## Delete Products

At the bottom of this window next to Update and Cancel is now a Delete button. Clicking this will remove all data stored on this product, so be sure when clicking this. The save isn't immediate though, so copy the data.json file in your /resource folder before any other action if this was a mistake.
