# Adding an Expense

The Buying tab is used to save records of expenses.

The following are required fields:

**Quantity:** This is the count of items you are buying. Note: There is no calculation between quantity and cost. 10 bubble mailers that cost $1 each should be entered as 10 bubble mailers with a cost of $10.

**Name of Purchase:** This can be whatever the product name is. ie. Thread (Spools), Bubble Mailers, Domain Renewal, Shipping Charge.

**Cost:** This is the total cost of the item. Note: Again, there is no calculation between quantity and cost.

Then there is one field that is not required, but it is helpful.

**Tags:** This, like selling tags is for your open-ended organization of records. This field works differently though in that it is a single field to enter all tags (separated by commas). Suggestions here might be things like Tools, Supplies, Reship.

There is a preset drop down here too. How that works, is that you fill in the known fields and hit Save. So if you have an item that changes price here and there, but you always buy 1 of it: Fill out the quantity, name, and tag, but leave cost empty. In the saved presets option, you will see what fields have captured data.

- **#**: Quantity
- **$**: Cost
- **üßæ** Name
- **üè∑** Tags

If you save a preset with either "Hosting" or "Payroll" for name or tags, these will link to the buttons of those names. This helps with say you have a recurring BigCartel hosting charge each month. Save [1, BigCartel, 9.99, Hosting]. The button will save you from scowering the drop down list every month.

## Buttons

**Add:** Add will propigate the filled in fields to itemize them to the receipt. You can add as many items as makes sense.

**Submit:** Once all items on the receipt are ready to log to the database, click Submit.

**Save:** Save will create a Saved Items preset with the exact fields you have filled out.

**Cancel:** Clears all fields and receipt.
