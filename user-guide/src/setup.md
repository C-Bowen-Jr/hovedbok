# Setup

The following are things needed to be ste up before using Hovedbok.
- Add Logo and Product Images
- Company Info
- Remove Sample Product
- Add Your Products

## Add Logo and Product Images

In the root directory that contains the Hovedbok executable there are two important folders. ```/resource``` and ```/products```. We are going to put some image files in each of these.

The first image you want to copy is the logo file in a .PNG format. This is to be used on your packing slips. More horizontal images are best for the space available. Put a copy of this image in your ```/resource``` folder. We'll tell Hovedbok the filename at a later step.

Next is to copy images of your products into the ```/products``` folder. These can be either .PNG or .JPG. The image grid displays them as squares, so if you have square images, use those. We'll tell Hovedbok what products these images go to at a later step.

## Company Info

Now we'll open Hovedbok and enter our info that will be on used on the packing slip.

**Company Name**, **Address**, **Unit**, **City**, **State**, and **Zip** are all your return address lines. **Unit** is for apartments, units, or suite numbers if one applies. Leave it blank if there isn't one.

**Website** is your website url if you have one. You can also choose to fill this with an email address if you'd prefer.

**Choose File** is the file selector we said we'd get back to in the Addd Logo step. Click this and navigate into that ```/resource``` folder and select your company logo. Remember, this needs to be a .PNG.
