# Optional Steps

The following fields are optional:

**Tags:** This is for records organization. Tags can be saved or entered freely. Use them as you see fit to organize and recall sale records. Keep track of coupon codes? Add the tags "coupon" and/or "BLACKFRIDAY". International sale? Add that.
 - (**Saved <-** Manual) Saved Tags: This is the drop down list of already saved tags.
 - (Saved **-> Manual**) New Tag: This is where you enter new tags. Click Add to add without saving. Click Save to save it to the drop down list.

 **Gift Message:** Some customers might ask to convey a gift message if buying for someone else. This will carry over to the packing slip.
