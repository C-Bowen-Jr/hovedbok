# Hovedbok

"Hovedbok" is Norwegian for "ledger". Hovedbok is an open source version of my in house built ledger software. It differs in that this version has features that make useage easier for an end user. Compared to my own which is built exactly what I need it for and nothing more.

## Current State

Currently, the project is not in a working version.
